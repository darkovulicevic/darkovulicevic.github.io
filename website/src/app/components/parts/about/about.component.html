    Experienced Software Engineer with over four years of hands-on expertise in building and
    maintaining scalable desktop and web applications. At Enreach Labs, I’ve led and contributed to a wide
    range of impactful projects—from developing real-time communication platforms to implementing Drone CI/CD pipelines,
    managing Nginx and proxy servers, and migrating large-scale systems for improved performance and scalability.
    My core work involves creating user-focused features using modern JavaScript frameworks, especially Angular, and more recently, React.
    I’ve also been responsible for maintaining custom component libraries across multiple applications, ensuring design consistency and development efficiency.
    Alongside application development, I manage infrastructure tasks, including domain configurations, SSL certificate handling, and secure traffic routing.
    I bring a well-rounded approach to software development, combining technical expertise with adaptability, problem-solving, and a focus on delivering reliable, high-quality solutions.
